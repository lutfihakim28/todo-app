## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- LocalStorage
- [SortableJs](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/) - JS library for drag and drop the list element

### What I learned

I learn many things from this challenge. Especially on JavaScript. This challenge is hard but I enjoy the struggle.

I learn that I must separate script for managing the data and script for showing the data. In my first attempt of this challenge, I got struggle very hard because I have a single function that store data and show it in the HTML.
